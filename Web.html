        <h1>Importance Of Git Software</h1>
        <p>Git is a version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating<br>
        work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. its goals include speed,<br>
    data intergrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
    <h2><strong> Why it is so<br>
    important to use it<br>
   in our projects</strong></h2>
   <h3>1.Collaboration</h3>
   <p>A version control system helps the developers effieciently track all the modifications that have been made in the source<br>
code.While managing the changes, it also records what changes have been done by whom and when.As we know, a project is developed<br>
by a group of people, and each one of them can configure different features for the code using the Git software</p>
<h3>2.Version storage</h3>
<p>Version control system helps you to manage multiple versions of a progect and keeps the source code organized meanwhile.<br>
It allows for creating branch for every developer who makes changes with the original code without being analyzed by the other<br>
developers.</p>
<h3>3.Previous Version Restoration</h3>
<p>Since the version control system keeps track of every modification, if we face a bug in the updated version and the new<br>
is not working correctly, it would be much easier to omit the latest changes and continue with the previous version.Depending<br>
on the size of your project, this process can be pretty complex.If you use GIT, you shouldn't have this problem.You can access<br>
the last saved version of your project at any time, or you can return it any day.</p>
